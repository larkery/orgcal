#+TITLE: org mode android calendar provider
#+AUTHOR: Tom H

* What is it

This is an android calendar & contacts provider designed to sync android's contentproviders with some flat files.

The calendar provider syncs with org-mode files, and the contacts provider with some arbitrary json format.

* Misfeatures

Org-mode timestamps can't represent the full range of icalendar dates.

I don't care about this in general, icalendar is weirdly overspecified.

However I do like to be able to write events that are like "every N days / weeks etc, until some date" without replicating headings which is the suggested solution.

To do this I abuse the unsupported syntax:

#+begin_src org
  <2022-07-12 Tue +5d>--<2022-09-06 Tue>
#+end_src

To mean "every 5 days until the end date".

To make this work you need the following advice:

#+begin_src elisp
(defun filter-org-agenda-get-blocks (blocks)
    (with-no-warnings (defvar date))
    (let* ((current (calendar-absolute-from-gregorian date))
           (dotime))
      (cl-loop
       for block in blocks
       do (setq dotime (and block (get-text-property 0 'dotime block)))
       when (and dotime
                 (string-match-p org-repeat-re dotime)
                 (string-match org-ts-regexp dotime))
       when (= current (org-time-string-to-absolute (match-string 1 dotime)
                                                    current
                                                    'future))
       collect block)))

(advice-add 'org-agenda-get-blocks
            :filter-return
            #'filter-org-agenda-get-blocks)
#+end_src
